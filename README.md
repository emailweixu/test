- [Chinese Documentation](http://paddlepaddle.org/doc_cn/)
   
- [Quick Start](http://paddlepaddle.org/doc/demo/quick_start/)

   You can follow the quick start tutorial to learn how use PaddlePaddle
   step-by-step.

- [Example and Demo](http://paddlepaddle.org/doc/demo/)

   We provide five demos, including: image classification, sentiment analysis,
   sequence to sequence model, recommendation, semantic role labelling.

- [Distributed Training](http://paddlepaddle.org/doc/cluster)

  This system supports training deep learning models on multiple machines
  with data parallelism.

- [Python API](http://paddlepaddle.org/doc/ui/)

   PaddlePaddle supports using either Python interface or C++ to build your
   system. We also use SWIG to wrap C++ source code to create a user friendly
   interface for Python. You can also use SWIG to create interface for your
   favorite programming language.
